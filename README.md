# ðŸª„: AI Interior Design

This Colab notebook demonstrates how AI can help redesign and visualize your room based on an inspiration image and a simple text description. You can describe a design style and upload a reference inspiration image, and the AI will transform your room while preserving its layout and structure.

## What It Can Do

âœ… Transform your room into different styles using AI  
âœ… Preserve the original layout using structure-detection  
âœ… Use a **reference image** to guide the design  
âœ… Generate photorealistic concepts â€” fast!

## Under the Hood â€” How it works

This project combines several powerful AI tools in a creative pipeline:

### Stable Diffusion + Custom Model

We use a fine-tuned version of **Stable Diffusion** called **[InteriorDesignSuperMix](https://civitai.com/models/85691/interiordesignsupermix)** â€” a model specialized for generating high-quality, photorealistic interior scenes.  
It helps ensure the output fits real-world room aesthetics.

### ControlNet + MLSD (Mobile-optimized Line Segment Detection)

To **preserve the room layout** (walls, edges, furniture positions), we use **ControlNet** with **MLSD (Mobile-optimized Line Segment Detection)**:

- **MLSD** analyzes the input photo and extracts clean straight line maps (white straight lines on a black background)
- These lines act like a "blueprint" that guides the AI, so it doesnâ€™t distort the room structure when redesigning

### IP-Adapter (Image Prompt Adapter)

Besides text prompts, the tool uses a **style reference image** via **IP-Adapter**. This allows the AI to "look at" another reference room image and apply a similar aesthetic to your room photo.

For example: Want your bedroom to look similar to a Scandinavian living room that you like? Just upload an image of one!

## Project Structure

- `AI_Interior_design.ipynb`: The main Colab notebook
- `/AI_Interior_design_data/`: Example room and style images
- `/Checkpoints/`: Model checkpoints downloaded during runtime

## How to Use

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab  
   [Open Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Patcharinee/AI_Interior_design/blob/main/AI_Interior_design.ipynb)

2. Upload:
   - A photo of your room as "original_image" and change the file path accordingly (original_image = load_image("YOUR FILE PATH HERE"))
   - A reference image of your preferred design style as "style_image" and change the file path accordingly (style_image = load_image("YOUR FILE PATH HERE"))

3. Type a description of the style you want in "text_prompt" 
   e.g., `"a cozy Scandinavian bedroom"`

4. Run the notebook cells step-by-step

5. Download your newly designed room!

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Stable Diffusion | Image generation |
| InteriorDesignSuperMix | Fine-tuned SD model for interior design |
| ControlNet (MLSD) | Preserves structural layout using line maps |
| IP-Adapter | Enables image-based style transfer |
| CLIP Vision | Image embedding and comparison |
| Transformers & Diffusers | Open-source AI model libraries |
| PyTorch | Core deep learning framework |

## Limitations

- Results are AI-generated and **conceptual** â€“ great for inspiration, but not exact measurements
- Works best with clear, bright photos of rooms
- Some styles or inputs may result in less realistic results (trial & error helps!)
